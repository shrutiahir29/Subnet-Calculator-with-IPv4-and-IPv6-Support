Subnet Calculator Web App (IPv4 & IPv6)

Project Overview

The Subnet Calculator Web Application is an interactive tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that helps users calculate subnet-related information for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
It visually demonstrates how networks are divided into subnets and how parameters like network address, broadcast address, prefix length, and usable host range are derived.

The web app automatically detects whether the entered address is IPv4 or IPv6 and displays the relevant subnet details — including IPv6 address compression and expansion, CIDR notation, and prefix length insights.
